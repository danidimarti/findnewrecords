# HOW TO FIND NEW RECORDS OF A LIST USING THIS SIMPLE PYTHON SCRIPT

#### 1. Download Python on your computer: https://www.python.org/downloads/
>The most recent versions of python already come with IDLE by default. IDLE is a simple file editor you can use to open and edit your script. 


#### 2. Now open the command prompt from your computer. 
> Tip: you can do this by pressing windows + R and writing cmd on the search field

#### 3. Install the Pandas package. 
> Pandas is a python library that allows you to do all sorts of data analysis. To do this write on the command line: *pip install pandas*

#### 4. Now open the script using IDLE or any editor of your choice to start adapting the script to your needs. 

## ADAPTING THE SCRIPT. 

#### 1. To run this script you need two files:
* **Base File**: this is your history file, that is, the file that you are going to base your research on. For example, if you want a “new donors 2020” list, your base file would be your entire list of donors, excluding the year of 2020. 
* **Comparison file**: this is the file you want to compare your list to. Following the same example, the comparison file will be the list of donations made in 2020. 

> IMPORTANT: if you add the script file in the same folder where both your base and your comparison lists are saved, you only need to add their name and extension in the script. Otherwise, you will need to add the entire path of where the csv are stored, like so: ‘C:\Users\Owner\Desktop\WORK\Python Analysis\hist-DonorsList.csv’ 

#### 2. Now replace the files names in green with yours. Make sure you are using simple quotes:
